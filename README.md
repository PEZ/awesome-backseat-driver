## Install

To install the Marketplace and the **clojure** plugin:

1. Install/configure **Awesome Backseat Driver** as a provider of plugins:
  1. From the VS Code command palette: **Chat: Install Plugin from Source**
  1. Paste: https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/awesome-backseat-driver
  1. Select **clojure**
     ![Select Awesome Clojure Plugin](assets/howto/plugin-selector.png)
1. You will also want to installing the **clojure-editor** plugin:
  1. From the VS Code command palette: **Chat: Plugins**
  1. Append plugin name in the search box, e.g. **clojure-editor**
  1. Click **Install**

The minimal starter-pack, IMO, is the **clojure** plugin, the **clojure** instructions, and the **clojure-editor** subagent. There is some cross-referencing going on between these. Also IMO, you need the **babashka**, **joyride**, and **epupp**, plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> Plugins contain agents and skills. Both types of content are lazy loaded by the agent, so they will not hurt your agents context window just by being there. They will only add some little description so that the agent knows when to load them.

Instructions and prompts have install buttons in the rendered markdown from this site. You can of course just copy the content of anything you want on your machine(s) from this repo and configure manually in VS Code.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|---|---|
| `clojure` | REPL-first Clojure development — agent and skill for any dialect and runtime |
| `clojure-editor` | Subagent for editing Clojure files using Backseat Driver structural editing tools |
| `babashka` | Babashka scripting and bb.edn task skills for idiomatic Babashka development + babashka tasks |
| `joyride` | Joyride skills for VS Code automation with ClojureScript — scripting, user scripts, and workspace automation |
| `epupp` | Browser tampering and userscript development with Epupp, ClojureScript/Scittle in any browser page you need it. (Which in my case is all the pages!) |

## Instructions

Instructions can't be bundled in plugins — install them separately:

| Instruction | Description | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `clojure` | Tiny. Nudge to help the Agent decide to load the Clojure skill | [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot/install/agent?url=vscode%3Achat-instructions%2Finstall%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FBetterThanTomorrow%2Fawesome-backseat-driver%2Fmaster%2Finstructions%2Fclojure.instructions.md) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot/install/agent?url=vscode-insiders%3Achat-instructions%2Finstall%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FBetterThanTomorrow%2Fawesome-backseat-driver%2Fmaster%2Finstructions%2Fclojure.instructions.md) |

## Relationship to Calva Backseat Driver

The **Calva Backseat Driver extension** provides the foundational tooling layer of instructions so that the agent *can* and knows *how* to do REPL evaluation, structural editing, symbol lookup, etcetera. Install it from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva-backseat-driver).

This marketplace (as the Copilot team terms it) provides
1. More optinonated instructions for the AI to produce high quality Clojure code and use the REPL effectively.
2. More specific information around this or that Clojure dialect or runtime, or this or that library or framework / tool / etcetera.
3. More opinionated instructions about the use of subagents, etecetera

## WIP

This repo will mature both in terms of its content and structure. Right now it is very raw and maybe not the easiest to contribute to (and certainly not to maintain).
